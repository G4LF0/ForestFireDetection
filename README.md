#  **Fire, Smoke, and Vegetation Detection Algorithm**
This is a computer vision algorithm that can detect fire, smoke, and vegetation in images using machine learning techniques. It takes as input a digital image and outputs a classification of the image as one of the following categories:

* Fire: the image contains visible flames and/or thermal hotspots that suggest the presence of a fire.
* Smoke: the image contains visible smoke plumes and/or hazy regions that suggest the presence of smoke.
* Vegetation: the image contains visible greenery and/or natural textures that suggest the absence of fire or smoke.
